% Nim game predicates (move generators, terminal positions, ...)
% A nim position is represented by the term nim(turn, [n_0, ..., n_k]) where n_i
% represents the number of matches left in row i. turn is one of ["us", "them"].

% Move generator

	gennext(Pos, Next),
	ldiff(Pos, Next, Diff),
	c0(Diff, Count),
	Count == 1,
	nextturn(T, T1).

% Both [H| L] and [H1| L1] must be fully instantiated

% [H| L] must be fully instantiated
